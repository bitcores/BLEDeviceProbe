BLE Device Probe
=========

This app displays the GATT services and characteristics the connected Bluetooth SMART (BLE)
device makes available. At this point that is all it does but I aim to add features that will
result in it becoming similar to most other similar apps on Google Play

The main feature of this app though is that it is using the BtAdapter library I am making and
developing this will help me in developing the BLE side of that.
